    <h1>Server Maintenance Notice</h1>
    <p>Dear Meow Tech Open Source Products, Homework Board, DesertUltra/Revision Pocket, and Yau Yau's Diary
        users,</p>
    <p>The Server department of Meow Tech Open Source would like to inform you that we are currently undergoing a major
        migration from a Windows Server infrastructure to a Linux infrastructure. This migration is being carried out to
        provide you with a more stable, secure, and efficient platform for your applications and services.</p>
    <p>Please be advised that during this migration period, our server will be temporarily offline, and all services
        relying on our servers may stop functioning for a while. This includes applications that rely on our OTA
        (over-the-air) and Leak Protection services, such as MyBP. New installations of these applications may not work
        until the migration process is complete. However, old users of these applications can continue to use them
        without any updates.</p>
    <p>Please note that this is because each application registers online to check for its application status, and this
        registration process may be affected during the migration period. We understand the inconvenience this may cause
        and we apologize for any disruption this may bring to your business.</p>
    <p>We assure you that we are doing everything possible to ensure the migration process goes smoothly, and that we
        will work tirelessly to minimize any disruptions to your services. We expect to complete the migration process
        and have the server back online by 1st July. However, please note that this is an estimated timeframe, and there
        may be unforeseen circumstances that may cause some delays. We will keep you updated throughout the migration
        process.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this migration, please do not hesitate to contact us at
        support@yourdomain.com. Our support team will be available to assist you with any questions or concerns you may
        have.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your patience and understanding in this matter.</p>
    <p>Best regards,</p>
    <p>Meow Tech Open Source Developers & Staffs</p>
